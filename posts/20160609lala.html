<h3>LalaCorp, Ltd.</h3>
<div>
<span style="font-style:italic">Lala ki Dukaan</span> (लाला की दुकान). I find myself using this phrase often to classify workplaces and working conditions. The phrase itself has been <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3ttgbu/what_is_a_lala_company/">discussed</a> <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4c0or3/eli5_what_is_a_lala_company/">many</a> times before. Current staff have <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/njzjn/lala_company_rage/">lamented</a> being a part of one and former staff have <a href="https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:8vaJ3gg5KqUJ:https://www.glassdoor.com.au/Reviews/Employee-Review-Media-Mosaic-RVW10302770.htm+&cd=25&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=in&client=ubuntu">called</a> <a href="https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:fofrPuok8LUJ:https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Force-Motors-RVW3125519.htm+&cd=2&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=in&client=ubuntu">out</a> <a href="https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:0U2WeecRookJ:https://www.glassdoor.de/Bewertungen/Bewertungen-Kepler-Cannon-RVW7321157.htm+&cd=4&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=in&client=ubuntu">many</a> Glassdoor as being one. Others have <a href="http://sanjaylakhotia.blogspot.in/2011/07/professional-vs-lala-company.html">shed</a> some light on the issue of how exactly one compares to a regular aka "professional" organization. </div>

While the phrase has many meanings and sometimes perjorative connotations, it has served many people well in summarizing their furstrations with corporate culture (or lack thereof) at current and former workplaces. In this piece, I intend to do something similar: explore the meaning I personally attach to the phrase and why I feel it captures much of what is wrong in an organization's culture.

<h5><span style="font-style:italic">Lala</span>s in Antiquity</h5>
The origins of the phrase are anything but clear. An oft repeated story, however, goes like this: the <span style="font-style:italic">lala</span> is a rotund and greedy moneylender also engaged in various small enterpises like running a goldsmithy or a warehouse. Said Lala's sole objective in life is to earn as much money as possible. On his quest to realizing his objectives, he treats employees as shit, double deals customers and generally behaves like a jerk. Wait... where have I seen that before...
</div>

<div>
The defining characteristics of a <span style="font-style:italic">Lala ki Dukaan</span> are more or less the same, viz.:
<ul>
<li>Inaccessible Management - Traditionally, run by the <span style="font-style:italic">Lala</span> himself and a handful of close kin</li>
<li>Singular focus on Profits - Making money at the expense of everything else. Often employing shady and borderline illegal tactics</li>
<li>Employee Averse - Late/non-payment of salaries, short or no leaves/vacation time and long work-hours for meagre pay</li>
</ul>
The employees at <span style="font-style:italic">Lala</span>'s place are generally in a disadvantaged position and there are overtones of bonded labour, although both these factors are not clearly spelled out.

<h5><span style="font-style:italic">Lala</span>s in the new Millennium</h5>
At the turn of the century, a lot of things changed. Seemingly magical things became common place. Somethings however, remained the same and in a few cases took a turn for the worse. The "mircale" of outsourcing marked a return of the <span style="font-style:italic">Lala ki Dukaan</span>. Big Time. With sycophancy and petty politics added on top. While the <span style="font-style:italic">lala</span> culture had never left, the outsourcing boom brought it out to forefront again. Only this time, the <span style="font-style:italic">lala</span> was a tie-wearing, MBA toting sycophant.
</div>
<br/>
<div>
As things settled down in boom town, there seem to be multiple strat of <span style="font-style:italic">Lala ki Dukaan</span>s operating today:
<ul>
<li>Tier 1 - TCS, Infy, Wipro etc (2-3L+ bodies)</li>
<li>Tier 2 - TechM, L&T Infotech, CTS etc (70k-1.5L bodies)</li>
<li>Tier 3 - iGATE and ilk (sub-70k bodies)</li>
<li>Tier 4 - Others (sub-5k bodies)</li>
</ul>
Within each tier, the "core" culture is more of less the same. While Tiers 1 through 3 are generally prompt with salary and other payments, Tier-4 is a whole different ballgame.
