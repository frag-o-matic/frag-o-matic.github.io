I find myself using this phrase often to classify workplaces and working conditions. The phrase itself has been <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3ttgbu/what_is_a_lala_company/">discussed</a> <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4c0or3/eli5_what_is_a_lala_company/">many</a> times before. Current staff have <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/njzjn/lala_company_rage/">lamented</a> being a part of one and former staff have <a href="https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:8vaJ3gg5KqUJ:https://www.glassdoor.com.au/Reviews/Employee-Review-Media-Mosaic-RVW10302770.htm+&cd=25&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=in&client=ubuntu">called</a> <a href="https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:fofrPuok8LUJ:https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Force-Motors-RVW3125519.htm+&cd=2&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=in&client=ubuntu">out</a> <a href="https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:0U2WeecRookJ:https://www.glassdoor.de/Bewertungen/Bewertungen-Kepler-Cannon-RVW7321157.htm+&cd=4&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=in&client=ubuntu">many</a> Glassdoor as being one. Others have <a href="http://sanjaylakhotia.blogspot.in/2011/07/professional-vs-lala-company.html">shed</a> some light on the issue of how exactly one compares to a regular aka "professional" organization. </div>

<div>
While the phrase has many meanings and sometimes perjorative connotations, it has served many people well in summarizing their furstrations with corporate culture (or lack thereof) at current and former workplaces. In this post, I intend to explore the meaning I personally attach to the phrase and why I feel it captures much of what is wrong in an organization's culture.

<h5><span style="font-style:italic">Lala</span>s of Antiquity</h5>
The origins of the phrase are anything but clear. An oft repeated story, however, goes like this: the <span style="font-style:italic">lala</span> is a rotund and greedy businessman also engaged in various small/medium enterpises like running a goldsmithy or moneylending/pawn-brokerage or a warehouse etc. Said Lala's sole objective in life is to earn as much money as possible. On this quest to earn $$$, he leaves no stone unturned. He's the <span style="font-style:italic">desi</span> version Dickens' Scrooge, in a nutshell.
</div>
<br/>
<div>
Given <span style="font-style:italic">Lala</span>'s mentaily and his singular aim of running after $$$, any enterprise -- typically a goldsmithy or another labor intensive shop (<span style="font-style:italic">dukaan</span> in Hindi) -- under his supervision is hell on earth. Employees are treated like sh*t. Double dealing customers is a daily affair and "Shady Business Practices" is an understatement. The phrase <span style="font-style:italic">Lala ki Dukaan</span> is convenient way to sum up all of this.
</div>
<br/>
<div>
<h5><span style="font-style:italic">Lala</span>, MBA</h5>
At the turn of the century, a lot of things changed. Seemingly magical things became common place and "miracle" of outsourcing marked a return of the <span style="font-style:italic">Lala ki Dukaan</span>. Big Time. With sycophancy and petty politics added on top. While the real <span style="font-style:italic">lala</span> culture had never left, the outsourcing boom brought more people in contact with it. Only this time, the <span style="font-style:italic">lala</span> was a tie-wearing, MBA toting sycophant.
</div>
<br/>
<div>
<h5>tl;dr</h5>
Be it the eighties or the naughties, the defining characteristics of a <span style="font-style:italic">Lala ki Dukaan</span> are more or less the same, viz.:
<ul>
<li>Singular focus on Profits - Making money at the expense of everything else is the <span style="font-style:italic">mantra</span>. Shady practices and borderline illegal tactics are viewed as a necessary means to achieving this goal</li>
<li>Employee Averse - Late/non-payment of salaries. Short or zero days off. Long work-hours for meagre pay. Near-zero benefits and perks</li>
<li>Inaccessible Management - Traditionally, run by the <span style="font-style:italic">Lala</span> himself and a handful of close kin. Decisions are top-down and autocratic. Information is controlled</li>
</ul>
In the eighties, employees at <span style="font-style:italic">Lala</span>'s shop generally were expolited labour pulled from a disadvantaged pool. There are overtones of bonded labour, an illegal practice.

<h5>Meanwhile, Today...</h5>
Well educated youth with undergrad degrees or better find themselves stuck in a position similar to the reluctant employees of the <span style="font-style:italic">Lala ki dukaan</span> at the corner of the market <span style="font-style:italic">chauk</span>. The <span style="font-style:italic">lala</span>s too have changed. Gone are the days of the rotund, obscenities yelling business-man in a 30x20 shop. Instead, today we vast have cubicle farms and this...

<h5>A Taxonomy</h5>
As things settled down in the outsourcing boom town, there seem to be multiple distinct strata of <span style="font-style:italic">Lala ki Dukaan</span>s operating today:
<ul>
<li>Tier 1 - TCS, Infy, Wipro etc (aka Mass Recruiters, strength of around 2-3L+ bodies)</li>
<li>Tier 2 - TechM, L&T Infotech, CTS etc (aka Day-2 Recruiters, strength of around 70k-1.5L bodies)</li>
<li>Tier 3 - iGATE and ilk (aka Tail-enders, strength of &lt;70k bodies)</li>
<li>Tier 4 - Others (aka "startup" and "consultancy/staffing co" with &lt;500 bodies)</li>
</ul>
Within each tier, the "core" culture is more or less the same. Tiers 1 through 3 are generally household names with growing revenues and many long term projects. Consequently, they're prompt with salary and other payments. The upper tiers are infamous for having staff on "bench" (aka "free pool" or "unallocated" -- all euphemisms for a person not assigned to a project). The <span style="font-style:italic">Lala</span>s in this strata are line managers or resource managers if one happens to be on bench. Employee gripes are often with work hours, assignment to dead-end (no career/technical growth) roles etc. Most places operate like large corporates with lots of lipservice to promoting diversity, employee satisfaction and customer first.

Tier-4s and some of the lesser known and new-to-the-game Tier-3s are a whole another world. These are the real
