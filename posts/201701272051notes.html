<p>Frag's Writings :: Notes</p>
<h3>Notes</h3>
<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>
<p>Notes. A necessary evil to compensate for limited greymatter that a human has. Even more necessary when one is juggling too many things at a time. A simple paper and pen system is often a good start, as compared to keeping everything locked in the noggin, but in this digital age, one cannot help but wonder if there are better ways to deal with the problem of keeping notes and finding them one the need arises.</p>
<h3 id="note-taking-applications">Note-taking Applications</h3>
<p>There are plenty of note-taking applications, often with fancy interfaces and cloud sync capabilities. The problem with these though, is that they do not lend themselves to use in a locked down environment such as a college/work environment where the machine being used has a specific configuration and the user is not granted super user priviledges or the permission to install additional software. How then can one keep and reliably find notes in such an environment? Using existing tools and some <em>weird</em> conventions of course!</p>
<h3 id="a-convoluted-setup">A Convoluted Setup</h3>
<p>A simple plain-text based note-taking setup with support for rudimentary tags can be built using tools found in the standard C or C++ programmer's toolset, viz. A text-editor and <code>cscope</code> (alternatively, <code>ctags</code> with certain changes). Here's how yours truly built a similar system for keeping notes while in college (for the various labs)</p>
<ul>
<li>Create an empty directory to hold the notes, this could be in your <code>$HOME</code> dir for general notes or a sub-dir within the project or <code>doc</code> folder of your current workspace for the project/workspace specific stuff</li>
<li>Start with an empty file with a meaningful name (or timestamp using <code>touch $(date +&quot;%Y%m%d%H%M)</code>, for example. This invocation can be <code>alias</code>ed to a convenient bash command like <code>new_note</code>)</li>
<li>Add tags as you would declare a global variable in C, eg: <code>const int meta, mid_term_prj, lab02;</code></li>
<li>Create a list of notes to be indexed using <code>ls &gt; cscope.files</code> and run <code>cscope</code> over these with <code>cscope -b -q -k</code>. This will index all the tags (global variable declaration)</li>
<li>To find a note based on tags, run <code>cscope</code> in standalone mode with <code>cscope -d</code> (or from within your editor)</li>
<li>To find a note based on content. run <code>grep</code> or similar</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="limitations">Limitations</h3>
<p>Obviously this is an improvised system and has lots of limitations compared to a <em>real</em> note-taking program, some important ones are:</p>
<ul>
<li>If your notes are in the same dir as your source, the real variables in your code and the pseudo variables used as tags will get all mixed up</li>
<li>This &quot;solution&quot; will not scale well</li>
<li>No &quot;sync&quot; capabilities</li>
</ul>
